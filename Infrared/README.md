## IR Files

In this folder you'll find IR files you can use on the Flipper.
  
- GC_Upscaler.ir: Generic remote controller that you can teach the [GCPlug GameCube upscaler](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KJw7jaHvL.jpg) to use.  
  
- G_Light_A60.ir:  Remote controller for the [G-Light A60 RGB bulb](https://a-static.mlcdn.com.br/1500x1500/lampada-led-a60-rgb-3w-autovolt-bocal-e27-g-light-glight-g-light/eletroarte/18ad4926d2eb11eca3cf4201ac18506b/c93863795074924c92f674205cb45df9.jpg), commonly found in Brazil but since it's a generic chinese lamp, others may be also able to use it.  
  
- HMDF.ir: Remote controller for the Holdmay Aroma Diffuser, works on a lot of models. I use this shit as an humidifier instead of an "diffuser" ("oils" aren't real science, hun).  
  
- LG.ir: Generic remote for somewhat newer LG TVs.
